      "body": "Why do we use it?\nIt is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).\n\n\nWhere does it come from?\nContrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.\n\nThe standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.\n\nWhere can I get some?\nThere are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.",

      "body": "Like a lot of people in the department, I feel passionate about what the Guardian stands for and I like that my work contributes to that. The Guardian provides a strong, challenging, independent voice in the media and I think that is more important than ever these days.\n\nAs for the work itself, I love to learn so I appreciate being able to collaborate with more experienced developers to improve my skills and knowledge. I would say though, one of the best parts of the role is that as a team we are responsible for shaping the work that we do. This includes research, cross team collaboration, planning and developing ideas. I appreciate not just being given work and told to go away and do it but, instead, being part of an evolving process.",

      "title": "Remotely job",
      "body": "When starting a new role there is always an element of nerves and anxiety. You want to do well but it’s also a steep learning curve. I started working for the Guardian during the first lockdown in March last year, so going through that in the context of a pandemic was pretty daunting. Even so, I now feel very comfortable in my understanding of the department and the wider context of the work my team does. I think it’s a real credit to the leadership in our department that remote onboarding during such a challenging time went so smoothly.\n\nThere has been a genuine commitment to communication and knowledge sharing with weekly department seminars called ‘Techtimes’, which often focused on software engineering, and architecture overviews to understand the Guardian’s digital systems and how they fit together. These initiatives have really helped me achieve that understanding.\n\nI’m also doing some research at the moment on the impact of migrating data across multiple internal systems which means I’m having ongoing conversations with many different colleagues across product and engineering. It’s great because it’s sometimes difficult to visualise the department when you’re working remotely, so the more people I can interact with and talk to, the better my understanding of the whole department becomes.",
